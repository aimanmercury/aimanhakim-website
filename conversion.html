		What is Currency Conversion?
Currency conversion involves transforming the value of one currency into another. For instance, if you possess US dollars and want to determine its equivalent in Euros, you would initiate a currency conversion.

Why is it Essential?
Currency conversion holds paramount importance for international travelers requiring the exchange of their home currency for the local currency of the visited country. It is equally vital for businesses engaged in global trade and investors managing multiple currencies.

How Does it Operate?
Exchange rates signify the value of one currency in relation to another. For instance, if the exchange rate between the US dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR) is 1.2, it denotes that 1 USD is equivalent to 1.2 EUR. Understanding these rates facilitates seamless transactions and financial decisions across diverse currencies.
